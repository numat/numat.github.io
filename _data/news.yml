  description: On America’s roads, we’re seeing a lot more big vehicles, like buses
      and trucks, that run on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). So why don’t we see any
      passenger cars run on the same fuel? Because natural gas needs to be extremely
      compressed in order for us to use it, we need HUGE gas tanks, and they are too
      big to fit into most cars. In other words, the tank needs to be shrunk. One
      company is working on doing just that. Instead of compressing gas, they
      discovered that more gas can be stored if there are more surfaces for the
      methane molecules to attach to. The researchers are working on developing a
      cyrstal-like material, called NuMat, that can be placed inside small tanks.
      They say that just a gram of the material has the same surface area as a
      football field! The company is still young, but they feel they are well on
      their way in their mission to move the Planet Forward. In fact, the U.S.
      Department of Energy agrees -- they awarded NuMat a $1.5 million grant!

      automobiles currently by: storing natural gas at a lower pressure making
      natural gas fuel tanks safer; enabling design flexibility such that the tanks
      can be designed around current automobile underpinnings, reducing production
      costs and shortening development time; and increasing driving range. Their
      technology would also enable the possibility of refueling natural gas vehicles
      at home."
