      researchers have created two new record-setting synthetic materials with the

      NU-110, but first the mind-bending fact: if you were to unfold a crystal of
      NU-110 the size of a grain of salt, the surface area would cover a desktop."

  description: On America’s roads, we’re seeing a lot more big vehicles, like buses
      and trucks, that run on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). So why don’t we see any
      passenger cars run on the same fuel? Because natural gas needs to be extremely
      compressed in order for us to use it, we need HUGE gas tanks, and they are too
      big to fit into most cars. In other words, the tank needs to be shrunk. One
      company is working on doing just that. Instead of compressing gas, they
      discovered that more gas can be stored if there are more surfaces for the
      methane molecules to attach to. The researchers are working on developing a
      cyrstal-like material, called NuMat, that can be placed inside small tanks.
      They say that just a gram of the material has the same surface area as a
      football field! The company is still young, but they feel they are well on
      their way in their mission to move the Planet Forward. In fact, the U.S.
      Department of Energy agrees -- they awarded NuMat a $1.5 million grant!

  description: "NuMat Technologies is commercializing a new class of
      nanomaterials that can store gases just like a sponge soaks up water. One of
      their nanomaterials would be for natural gas tanks used in everyday motor
      vehicles. This material can overcome the major hurdles impeding natural gas
      automobiles currently by: storing natural gas at a lower pressure making
      natural gas fuel tanks safer; enabling design flexibility such that the tanks
      can be designed around current automobile underpinnings, reducing production
      costs and shortening development time; and increasing driving range. Their
      technology would also enable the possibility of refueling natural gas vehicles
      at home."

      (the United States, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia,
      France, Germany, Mexico, Norway, Singapore and Thailand) competed for a prize
      package worth $135,000. This was the 29th annual competition. Grand prize
      winner NuMat Technologies, which hails from Northwestern University in
      Illinois, is a clean energy company that designs and creates high-performance
      materials to store clean fuels and produce them on a large scale for industry.
